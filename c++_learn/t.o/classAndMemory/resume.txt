naked pointers
For naked pointers:
they provide shallow or bitwise copying or assignment: 
They just copy or assign the data members from the source object directly to the destination object.

This is called a dangling pointer 
	-Now s1 has a pointer which no longer points to valid memory. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
orphaned the memory: when obj1 and obj2 points to the same memory but, s2 had a pointer memory orphante
Orphaned memory = Memory leak
Good Advice:
Whenever you have dynamically allocated memory in a class, you
should write your own copy constructor and assignment operator to provide a
deep copy of the memory.

Assignment Operator:
. Thus, you must free any dynamically allocated memory before allocating new memory. You can think of an
assignment operator as a combination of a destructor and a copy constructor. You are essentially
“reincarnating” the object with new life (or data) when you assign to it.
check for self-assignment

Factor copy and assignment operator
create an intermediate method copyFrom()

Disallowing copy and assignment operator

s. In fact, a static method is just like a regular
function. The only difference is that it can access private and protected static data members of
the class. It can also access private and protected non-static data members on objects
of the same type,
