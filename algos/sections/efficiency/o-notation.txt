O notation: O(n)
These are the most common O -notations in algorithms:

O(1) -> Constant time, Doesn't depend of the input size.
O(log N) -> Often halves the input size.
O(srqt(N)) -> Special property sqrt(N) = sqrt(N)/N
O(N) -> Goes throught the input
O(N log N) -> Often indicates the algorithm sorts the input.
O(N^2) -> Often two nested loops, thorught all pairs of the input elements
O(N^3) -> Often three nested loops, throught all triplets of the input elements
O(2^N) -> Often indicates that algorithm goes throught all subsets of the input element.
O(N!) -> The algorithm iterates throught all permutations of the input elements.
